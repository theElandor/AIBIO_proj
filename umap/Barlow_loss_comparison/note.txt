Plots done on the HUVEC_0 fold (training set).
In this plots, I compare the ViT embeddings with and without the barlow
loss, which considerably increases the downstream performance. 6c_13 is 
the bakbone with the barlow loss, while 6c_14 is the first ablation in which
I just turn off the barlow loss.
We can observe a big red cluster on the top left corner in the backbone
trained with no barlow loss. No big differences anyway.
