Plots done on the HUVEC 0 fold (training set).
The 6c_17 plot (hard augmentations, multi_centering active) has a very weird shape.
It feels weird that the downstream performance does not change even
if the embeddings are a lot different from the ones of the other backbone (easy augmentations, multi_centering active).
