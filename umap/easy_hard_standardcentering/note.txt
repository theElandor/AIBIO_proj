Plots done on the HUVEC 0 fold, training set only as usual.
I will compare the embeddings of these two backbones:
+ Backbone trained with easy augmentation and standard centering (6c_13);
+ Backbone trained with HARD augmentations and standard centering (6c_15);
Also in this case, the hard augmentations have a huge impact on the shape
of the embeddings. But also in this case, no change in the downstream
performance is observed. :(
